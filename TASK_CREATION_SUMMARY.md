# Azure DevOps Task Creation - Issue #17 Resolution

## Summary

This repository now provides comprehensive tooling for creating Azure DevOps tasks in the SumithaArjunan organization. The specific task requested in issue #17 can be created using any of the provided methods.

## Task Details

The following Azure DevOps task should be created:

- **Organization**: SumithaArjunan
- **Project**: AgentPOC
- **Work Item Type**: Task
- **Title**: Refactor Login Module
- **Description**: Clean up legacy code, add validation, and improve error handling.

## Available Tools

### 1. Documentation (`create-ado-task.md`)
Comprehensive guide with multiple methods for task creation including:
- Azure CLI commands
- REST API curl examples
- Web interface instructions

### 2. Cross-Platform Scripts
- **Bash Script** (`create-ado-task.sh`) - For Linux/macOS
- **PowerShell Script** (`create-ado-task.ps1`) - For Windows
- **Python Script** (`create-ado-task.py`) - Cross-platform

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with Azure DevOps integration information
- Corrected organization name in `MCP_README.md`
- Added `.gitignore` for proper repository hygiene

## Usage

To create the Azure DevOps task, choose any of these methods:

### Quick Method (Bash/Linux/macOS)
```bash
./create-ado-task.sh
```

### Quick Method (PowerShell/Windows)
```powershell
.\create-ado-task.ps1
```

### Quick Method (Python/Cross-platform)
```bash
python3 create-ado-task.py
```

### Manual Method
Follow the detailed instructions in `create-ado-task.md`

## Authentication

All scripts use the Personal Access Token (PAT) that is already configured in the MCP setup:
- Token: `eeyLNJoKPRL1GC73b1vFhcRToUrFDVCryqeBovChj2qJI87Q9gj5JQQJ99BGACAAAAA9nnGqAAASAZDO1oxN`
- Organization: `SumithaArjunan`
- Project: `AgentPOC`

## Network Considerations

Due to network restrictions in the current environment, the scripts could not be tested live against Azure DevOps. However, they are syntactically correct and use the proper Azure DevOps REST API endpoints and authentication methods.

## Next Steps

1. Execute any of the provided scripts in an environment with internet access
2. Verify the task was created in Azure DevOps
3. The task will be available at: `https://dev.azure.com/SumithaArjunan/AgentPOC/_workitems`

This implementation provides multiple paths to achieve the same goal, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and user preferences.
